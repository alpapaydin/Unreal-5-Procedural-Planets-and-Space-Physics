# Procedural Planet Generator System in Unreal Engine 5

This project is a procedural planet generator system developed in Unreal Engine 5, utilizing UE5 geometry scripts and dynamic mesh component with Perlin noise. It allows for the generation of infinite planets using Perlin noise, and further includes custom gravity fields, gravity camera adjustment, foliage spawning, dynamic planet spawning, and despawning at runtime. Additionally, it features a cool spaceship model for exploration.

## Features

- **Infinite Planets**: Utilizes Perlin noise to generate endless variations of planets.
- **Custom Gravity Fields**: Define unique gravitational forces for each planet.
- **Gravity Camera Adjustment**: Adjust the camera to simulate gravitational effects.
- **Foliage Spawning**: Populate planets with vegetation and other environmental elements.
- **Dynamic Planet Spawning and Despawning**: Allows for the creation and removal of planets during runtime.
- **Spaceship Model**: Includes a visually appealing spaceship model for exploration.
